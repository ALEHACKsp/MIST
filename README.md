## Minimal Intervention and Software Transformation

This is a proof-of-concept packer that I created for a project in one of my university's courses.

Please note that the software is provided as is and comes with no warranty.

Remember to be ethical. :-)

## How to Set Up and Use

Place `Packer.dll` into the same directory as `Packer.exe`, select a target file and an output file and press `PACK`.

**Note**: If the target file is already compressed (for example, with UPX), then it will not work.
